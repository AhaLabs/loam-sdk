# loam-subcontract-ft

Contains an example of how to create a Subcontract interface. This example is for fungible tokens.

To find an implementation of the fungible token subcontract see, [examples/soroban/ft/src/ft.rs](../../examples/soroban/ft/src/ft.rs). 

Notice that a [Core Subcontract](../loam-subcontract-core) must be implemented to use any other Subcontracts, including this fungible token.
